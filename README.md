This is a project built with Next.js and MUI.

Unfortunately, it is unable to deploy due to significant memory requirements.

To run the web app, complete the following steps:

1. From https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data, download the Default Cards data, and name it as default-cards.json.
2. Add it to the cloned repository.
3. Open a terminal, and install all of the pip libraries included in requirements.txt.
4. run "py app.py".
5. Open a second terminal and run "npm run dev".
6. Visit http://localhost:3000/ on a web browser.
7. Install Sample_Collection.csv from the repository, and use it to experiment with the web app!
